            <h2>What do you do now?</h2>
            <p>Now that you know all this information and where depression originated from, what do you do to help prevent depression from getting worse?</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are multiple things you can do, either for yourself or somebody else, if they are experiencing depression. First of all, talk to yourself. Explain to yourself that today is not going to be the same as tomorrow. If you hear a voice saying you can't or won't get better, do the opposite and prove yourself wrong. Setting attainable goals and getting into a daily routine will allow you to achieve this success. Reward yourself after completion of the goals you set for yourself. After doing this, find activities that release seratonin or dopamine. Such activities may be exercise, talking to your friends, listening to music, being in nature and so on.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another thing you might want to consider is consulting a therapist to talk things through with. Although, this is not for everybody as some people might not be comfortable talking to others about a sensitive topic like depression.</p>
