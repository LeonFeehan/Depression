            <h2>A History of Depression</h2>
            <p>The earliest written accounts of what is now known as depression appeared in the second millennium B.C.E. in Mesopotamia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1917, Sigmund Freud wrote his thoughts on Meloncholy (An earlier name for depression) and published it in an essay titled “Mourning and Melancholia”. Freud described melancholy in a similar manner to our current view on depression, elaborating that melancholy is defined by: a sense of loss that arises when the object that has been lost is unknown, due to the mental process of repression.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With mental health theories appearing near the end of the 1900s, it became necessary to have a common ground for grouping, identifying and treating mental health conditions primarily based off of statistical data from field research. Therefore, a number of attempts were made to create a thorough mental health classification method.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Eventually, two main symptoms surfaced: the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD) in 1949, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1952. While the ICD queries both physical and mental ailments and is used across the globe, the DSM purely examines mental disorders and is mainly used in the US. The two are regularly updated to reflect ever-changing views on mental health.</p>
